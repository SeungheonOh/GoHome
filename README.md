# GoHome
Have you guys seen those cool looking single filed homepages on Linux communites? It looks really cool, but it's just a shallow shell
which only can let you go to pre-setted internet pages. GoHome in other hand, can do much more, such as opening applications,
shutting your system down, or fetching your system data to your local homepage. Not only that, GoHome also comes with 
easy setup system that does not require any tidious html coding processes, just simple and nice entrie lists-you can customize css as you desire.
